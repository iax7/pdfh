## Usage

After installing this gem, create your configuration file in one of the following directories:
- `~/.config/pdfh.yml`
- `~/pdfh.yml`
- or configure the `PDFH_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable

Example configuration:
```yaml
---
lookup_dirs:                   # Directories where all PDFs will be analyzed
  - ~/Downloads
destination_base_path: ~/PDFs  # Directory where all matching documents will be copied (MUST exist)
document_types:
  - name: My Bank                         # Description (type)
    re_file: '.*MyBankReg\.pdf'           # Regular expression to match its filename
    re_date: '\d{1,2} de (\w+) de (\d+)'  # Date regular expression
    pwd: base64_encoded                   # [OPTIONAL] Password if the document is protected
    store_path: "{year}/bank_docs"        # Relative path to copy this document
    name_template: '{period} {subtype}'   # Template for new filename when copied
    sub_types:                            # [OPTIONAL] In case your need an extra category
      - name: AccountX                       # Regular expression to match this subtype
        re_date: '\d{1,2} de (\w+)'          # [OPTIONAL] Date regular expression
        month_offset: -1                     # [OPTIONAL] Integer (signed) value to adjust month
zip_types:                     # [OPTIONAL] Zip files to be processed BEFORE the PDFs
  - name: My Bank 2                          # Description
    re_file: 'Document_MR5664_\d+_\d+.zip'   # Regular expression to match its filename
    pwd: base64_encoded                      # [OPTIONAL] Password if the document is protected
```

> [!CAUTION]
> `pwd` is not encrypted, so be careful with this option. It is stored as a base64 string as a very thin layer of obfuscation.
> You can use `echo -n 'password' | base64` to encode your password.

**Store Path** and **Name Template** supported placeholders:

Placeholder | Description               | Example
--- |---------------------------| ---
`{original}` | Original filename         | MyBankDocument2.pdf
`{period}`   | Year-Month                | 2022-01
`{year}`     | Year                      | 2022
`{month}`    | Month                     | 01
`{type}`     | Document type **name**    | My Bank
`{subtype}`  | Sub type **name**         | AccountX
`{extra}`    | day if captured/matched   | 01

`period`, `year`, `month` and `{extra}` are calculated from the date captured by the regular expression.

### Examples

Date text | RegEx | Captured
--- | --- | ---
`01/02/2025` | `(?<d>\d{2}\/(?<m>\d{2})\/(?<y>\d{4})` | d: `01` m: `02` y: `2025`
`072025 - ` | `(?<m>\d{2})(?<y>\d{4}) -` | m: `07` y: `2025`
